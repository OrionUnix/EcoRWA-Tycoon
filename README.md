# 🏙️ EcoRWA Tycoon

**Gamifying Real World Assets on Avalanche.**
*SimCity meets Real Estate Investment.*

---

## 📖 Project Overview
**EcoRWA Tycoon** is a decentralized crowdfunding platform that makes investing in Real World Assets (RWA) as simple and engaging as playing a city-building game.

We tackle the three biggest barriers to entry in real estate:
1.  **Complexity:** We use **AI** to analyze complex legal documents (PLU/Zoning laws) and translate them into simple game tips (Risks/Rewards).
2.  **Cost:** We use **Fractionalization (ERC-1155)** on Avalanche to allow investment starting at $50.
3.  **Boredom:** We turn passive income into a gamified "Tycoon" experience with visual progression.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **🎮 Interactive Map:** Browse "Parse City" and select buildings visually.
* **🤖 AI Urban Advisor:** An AI agent analyzes real-world Zoning Plans (PLU) to warn users about risks (e.g., "Roadworks ahead") or opportunities.
* **💸 One-Click Investing:** Purchase fractional ownership using MockUSDC on the Avalanche C-Chain.
* **📈 Live Yield System:** Watch your rental income grow in real-time (accelerated for the demo).
* **✅ Instant Compliance (Mock):** A simulated "Whitelist" system demonstrating readiness for KYC/AML Subnets.
